# CAPTCHA Service Frontend for Test Task

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this backend server, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (LTS version recommended, e.g., 16.x)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the backend up and running:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stuxnet0929/captcha_service.git
   cd captcha_service/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Available Scripts:**

    In the project directory, you can run:
    * Runs the app in the development mode.
        ```bash
        npm run start
        ```
        Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

        The page will reload if you make edits.\
        You will also see any lint errors in the console.

    * Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
        It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```

        The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
        Your app is ready to be deployed!
